It was a glorious day for a ride: 10 degrees Celcius, no wind, sunny.  I only had time for a super-fast short ride.  On the way back, though, my rear tire blew out.  Luckily, I had my new iPhone with me:  a quick call for a ride got me out of being stranded (and I also managed to snap a couple of photos while waiting).  Hopefully tomorrow will be better -- although I now have a clunker of a replacement tire on the back.
