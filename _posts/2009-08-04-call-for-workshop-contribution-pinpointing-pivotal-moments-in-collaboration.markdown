STELLAR 2009 Alpine Rendez-Vous




November 30-December 1 2009, in Garmisch-Partenkirchen (Germany)

Abstract




---------




In a previous workshop at the International Conference for the Learning Sciences




2008, entitled “A Common Framework for CSCL Interaction Analysis”, we




explored the diversity and commonality of the field on four dimensions: the purpose




of analysis, the units of interaction that are taken as basic in the




analysis, representations of data and analytic interpretations, and analytic




manipulations taken on those representations. We sought to establish requirements




for a common conceptual and representational framework to support collaborative




learning process analysis. To this end, our intention was to focus on three main




activities: namely, demonstrating our analytic tools to one another in the context of




analyses we conducted, identifying commonalities among these tools and analyses,




and generating requirements for a common conceptual model and abstract transcript.




This first workshop was followed by a second, called "Common Objects for




Productive Multivocality in Analysis" and held at the International Conference on




Computer Supported Collaborative Learning 2009. Our ongoing discussions




have trigged the addition of another dimension to our focus, that of theoretical




assumptions underlying the analysis. In addition to identifying potential common




objects for productive multivocality at these five levels (theoretical assumptions plus




the four levels from the first workshop), our goal was to identify differences or




divergences and whether these are complementary (potential sources of richer




understanding) or incompatible (potential barriers to a common discipline). The third




workshop in the series “Pinpointing pivotal moments in collaboration” will be held




at the Alpine Rendez-Vous 2009. New participants are welcome. The workshop will




serve to define what constitutes a pivotal moment during self- directed group




learning. In this way the workshop will address the first Grand Challenge in TEL




research, as shaped by STELLAR: “Connecting learners” – supporting self-




directed, self-managed and self-maintained communities and create successful new




forms of collaboration. The specific goals of the workshop are to use what we have




elaborated on interaction analysis in our two previous workshops in order to identify




these particular pivotal moments. Our long-term publication goal is to propose an




edited book in the CSCL book series on pivotal moments in collaboration to be




discussed during this workshop. In addition, the organizers will propose a journal




article for IJCSCL using the five previously mentioned dimensions to discuss




productive multivocality in generating insights for pivotal moments of collaboration.

Call for Participation




--------------




Interested researchers should submit at least a two-page abstract to




kristine.lund@univ-lyon2.fr by August 30th, 2009.




The abstract should indicate which type of participation is requested (see below -




basic participation, analyst/discussant, data presenter). Organizers will choose a




limited number of participants. Acceptance letters will be sent out on September




10th, 2009.







Basic Participation: Basic participants should submit at least two




pages summarizing their relevant prior experience, their objectives in participating in




this workshop, and a bibliography of relevant publications.  We also request a pointer




to one (or exceptionally two) relevant publication(s) and any relevant URL




demonstrating the researcherʼs work (for example a website dedicated to a particular




interaction analysis tool).







Analyst/Discussant: Researchers who wish to be selected as analyst or discussant




should meet the requirements for Basic Participation (2-page abstract as explained




above) and also submit up to two pages summarizing the following characterizations




of the analytic work they typically undertake in relation to how they understand the




notion of pivotal moments in collaboration: (1) theoretical assumptions; (2) purpose of




analysis; (3) units of interaction (4) notations for data and interpretations; and (5)




analytic manipulations.







Data Presenter: Researchers who wish to offer a data corpus should meet the




requirements for Basic Participation (2-page abstract as explained above) and also




submit up to two pages summarizing the nature of the corpus and making the case




that this data will serve the objectives of the workshop. Data presenters may also




serve as analysts or discussants.







The Alpine Rendez-Vous




--------------------------




This 2009 Alpine Rendez-Vous is the second event of a series. It is organized and




funded by STELLAR, a new European network of excellence on learning




technologies (http://www.stellarnet.eu/). It is not a conference but a set of




independent workshops held in the same hotel during the same week. Four




workshops will be held on the Monday-Tuesday and four other workshops on the




Wednesday-Thursday. On the Tuesday afternoon, all workshop participants are




invited to join a common section, the Rendez-Vous, ending up with a social event.







Financial aspects




------------------




Participants will be selected based on their submissions. There are no registration




fees. Participants pay for their own travel and lodging. However, funding for hotel and




food will be available for a limited number of participants and this will be decided by




the organizers.







Location




---------




The Alpine Rendez-Vous will be held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, a mountain village




in the South of Germany (http://www.garmisch-partenkirchen.de). Closest airports are




Munich and Innsbruck (in Austria).







Workshop Format and provisional schedule




-------------------




The 2-day workshop will be interactive and based on sharing corpora and analyses




with the negotiation of different roles taken on by the selected participants.




Each participant will apply for one of three roles: 1) data presenter, 2) analysis




presenter and/or 3) discussant. Each of the two data presenters chosen will not only




present the nature of the data and how it was collected, but also the original research




problem that inspired the data collection, whether the problem was theoretical or




practice-oriented as well as the original pivotal moments of collaboration that were




discovered. Analysis presenters will have access to chosen data before the




workshop and will do their own analyses on them (chosen data sets must thus be




shareable). It may be possible for teams of people to propose to present two different




analyses done on the same data set and thus occupy data presenter/first analysis




presenter as well as second analysis presenter roles. Discussants will have access




as well to data sets and analyses before hand in order to prepare their comments.




There will be 2 data presenter roles, 2 analysis presenter roles and 4 discussant




roles (see schedule below). The remainder of the workshop participants will be




expected to participate in general discussion.







Monday, November 30th, 2009




8:30 am -- 9:00 am: Short introduction to the objectives and structure of the




workshop




Kristine Lund







9:00 am -- 10:30 am: Each participant or team will give a 5 min introduction to their




work, essentially highlighting what they have written in their proposal so that




participants are sensitized to the voices of each of the participants/ teams.







10:30 -- 11:00: Coffee break







11:00 -- 12:00: Presentation of the first data set, its context and a first analysis







12:00 -- 12:30: Discussant: What are the consequences of the described pivotal




moments?







12:30 -- 13:30: Lunch







13:30 -- 16:30 Free time







16:30 -- 17:30: Presentation of a second analysis of first data set (different pivotal




moments of collaboration than first analysis)







17:30 -- 18:30: Discussant: What are the consequences of the described pivotal




moments?







18:30 -- 19:00: Coffee break







19:00 pm -- 20:00 pm: Discussant: Synthesis of two different analyses of pivotal




moments of collaboration on first data set: Insights and challenges for productive




multivocality.  What do each of the analytic perspectives expose about pivotal




moments? Can we productively use multiple analytic perspectives? How would one




use the results of such an analysis to inform collaborative learning?







Final discussions on what insights we have gained about common objects for




analysis and points of divergence; requirements for a common conceptual model and




abstract transcript
