As I was looking for resources about Lightroom, I wanted to quickly find Tim Bray's entries on the software so I Googled "lightroom bray" and came up with some [unexpected results](http://thesoftwarelife.blogspot.com/2007/06/adobe-lightroom.html). Unexpected only because I didn't think that a reference to Tim's log would rank higher than the original.  In any case, the read was interesting, but then I noticed the author's recent blog entries:  
  
[CouchDB](http://thesoftwarelife.blogspot.com/2007/12/couchdb.html)  
[Amazon SimpleDB ](http://thesoftwarelife.blogspot.com/2007/12/amazon-simpledb.html)  
  
I followed the link to [What You Need To Know About Amazon SimpleDB](http://www.satine.org/archives/2007/12/13/amazon-simpledb/) that led me to the [Amazon SimpleDB Home Page](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=342335011), which is more accessible than the Developer's guide.
