So it turns out that for twelve years we (IKIT) have been doing exactly that during our annual Summer Institute.  I believe that in addition to the very important role of bringing people together, such an approach to scholarship encourages the exposition of ideas.  Instead of having potentially brilliant ideas languish because they don't fit well with the status quo, providing the opportunity for ideas to be shared in a supportive environment quite possibly leadds to the rising to the top of the best ideas.

This year's conference will be held in Mallorca, Spain.  Unfortunately funding (or lack thereof) prevents me from attending the conference but several people have suggested that some of us "non-attenders" meet in North America.  Interesting idea!
