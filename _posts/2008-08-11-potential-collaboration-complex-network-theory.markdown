Today I had the honour of being visited by Jun and Ritsuko Oshima, a pair of researchers from [Shizuoka University](http://www.shizuoka.ac.jp/index.html).  We had a great chat about [some work that Jun has been doing](http://ikit.org/SummerInstitute2007/SI2007_papers/08_Oshima.pdf) over the past couple of years.  After a year of missing each other we finally managed to work out a plan for moving forward on complex network theory and socio-semantic network analysis.
