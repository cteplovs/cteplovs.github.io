About two years ago Bob McLean, a dear friend and colleague, was in London and shot this photo.  I liked the photo as soon as I saw it and have been looking for an opportunity to use it ever since.  There have been many significant changes in my life over the past few months, and this photo sums up things quite well.  The three signs in the photo are equally applicable.  Some of you who know me know that I have set a deadline of December 31st, 2008 for completing a draft of my thesis.  That's 14 weeks away.  I'm working to a tight deadline based on a detailed outline but I keep losing time to diversions (some unavoidable). The new year holds promise of great opportunities and I must finish. Tempus fugit.
