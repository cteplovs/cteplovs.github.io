Odd, really, to have my "about" message be the second entry in my blog.  I guess the previous entry was just a test post to see how blogger works. So what's this blog about?  It's about my life as it unfolds, right now.  Which means there are multiple threads: [work](http://ikit.org) (as in the stuff I'm paid to do, but which has a tendency to spill over into other parts of my life), home (being a dad, spouse, and friend), [school](http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/) (a unfortunate term for my doctoral work), and cycling (a recently re-found passion).  I envy people who can neatly compartmentalize their lives into separate worlds.  I have no such skill, and so things messily cross over from one realm to another.  Anyway, this is the story of my life.
