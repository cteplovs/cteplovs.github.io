I was tracking down the definition (and etymology) of the term "affordance" for a presentation I'm working on.  For some reason, my Mac's built-in dictionary doesn't know about the term and I wanted to ensure that is wasn't a neologism that had erroneously crept into my vocabulary.  
  
I managed to track down Don Norman's essay on [Affordance and Design ](http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/affordances_and.html)in which he explains how, in The Psychology of Everyday Things, he appropriated the term from James Gibson's earlier work.  (Wikipedia tells much the same story, but without Norman's flare.)  
  
A bit more poking reveals that Norman will be [talking](http://www.astc.org/conference/index.htm) in mid-October at the [Franklin Institute](http://www2.fi.edu/) in Phildelphia.  Interesting.
