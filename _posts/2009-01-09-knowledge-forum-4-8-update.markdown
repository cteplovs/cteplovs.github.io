This week marks my return to full-time work on Knowledge Forum 4.8.  I have made a flurry of check-ins to the code to make the communications protocol far more robust.  I have been unable to resist checking in several additional changes to improve the look, feel, and feature set.

The focus of the newer communications protocol is twofold:  improved behaviour across firewalls, which have been the bane of our existence for a very long time, and improved performance across slow or otherwise poor network connections.

Parties who are interested in helping out by offering test sites should contact me directly.
