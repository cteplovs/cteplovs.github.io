Here is a typical day for me in France:



	
  1. Wake up, pull on jogging clothes and head out for a morning jog around le Jardin de Luxembourg.  There are a lot of joggers out first thing in the morning!  I typically do two or three laps (3 laps is 5km), depending on how late it is.

	
  2. Stop by the local artisanal boulangerie to pick up one or two sourdough baguettes (or, if it's a Tuesday or a Friday, perhaps a croissant and a pain au chocolate).

  3. Say good morning to Nobuko and Tatiana.  Coffee is usually ready, so we sit down for a typically French petit déjeuner of coffee, baguette, butter, jam, and nutella

	
  4. Hop in the shower, get dressed, and head out the the RER station with the family.  I get a kiss goodbye and I'm off from Luxembourg to Bagneux.  The trip takes about 20 minutes and it's not crowded.  It's cheap too: 1.80EUR each way.  I suppose I could take a vélo, but there are a couple of tricky spots on the way thanks to construction.

	
  5. Get out at Bagneux station and walk down the hill to École Normale Supérieur de Cachan.  It's a pleasant walk.

  6. Get to work!  I share an office with Christophe Reffay and Françoise Tort.

	
  7. I often take a sandwich with me for lunch.  I am informed this is not the proper way to do things in France, and that a leisurely lunch with colleagues is the preferred way.  I try to join colleagues from the STEF lab for lunch a couple of times a week but time is so short here that I usually work through lunch.

	
  8. More work!  Usually I'm running out of steam, so I hit the Nespresso machine in the salle de réunion for one or two espressos.  

	
  9. Leave ENS and head up to Bagneux station.  There's a boulangerie at the RER station where I often pick up a baguette to snack on on the way home, and there's also a Franprix in case I want to pick up some groceries.

	
  10. Head to Luxembourg station on the RER and then a quick walk home.
	
  11. Dinner is usually ready for me when I get home, although I try to help out a couple of times during the work week.  Nobuko is an excellent cook and she works wonders with the limited facilities we have available to us.

	
  12. We often head out for a quick after-dinner walk around the neighbourhood, then we return to our flat, bathe Tatiana, read her some books, and put her to bed.  That gives us a couple of hours for adult time, tea, and cookies.
