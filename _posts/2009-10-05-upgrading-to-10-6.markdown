I finally took the plunge and upgraded my laptop to OS X 10.6.  Whereas the upgrade itself was straight-forward there have been some follow-up issues. 

1. QuickSilver needed to be upgraded and then the Plugins folder and plist had to be deleted.
2. Growl needed to be updated.
3. Mail needed to be configured for Exchange, which was a bit of a mystery process given that UofT hasn't yet posted instructions on how to do that.
4. iCal now syncs with Google Calendar and handles delegated calendars properly.

Now it's time to start looking at upgrading Eclipse.
