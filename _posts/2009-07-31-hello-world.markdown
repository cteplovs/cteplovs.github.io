I attended the [Science 2.0](http://softwarecarpentry.wordpress.com/2009/07/31/a-good-afternoon/) event at the mars centre yesterday and I was inspired by many of the speakers.  Over the next several days I will try to explain more about what I took away from each of the speakers but for now I think it's enough that I have started (yet another) blog where I can conduct my own type of science in the open.  I have my reasons for switching to WordPress, so I thank in advance all of you who come here from my [other](http://chris.ikit.org/blog) [blogs](http://cteplovs.blogspot.com/).
