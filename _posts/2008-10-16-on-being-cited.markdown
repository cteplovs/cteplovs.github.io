A couple of months ago I received email from [Angelique Dimitracopoulou](http://www.ltee.gr/adimitr) asking to use a couple of images from an article of mine from the [CSCL 2007](http://www.isls.org/cscl2007/) proceedings in a forthcoming journal article of hers.  Of course it's possible to use citation indices to see who's citing your stuff, but it's somehow more rewarding to hear from the author herself.  Of course I make no pretense about the fact that I was contacted only for high-res versions of the images, but it's still pretty cool.
