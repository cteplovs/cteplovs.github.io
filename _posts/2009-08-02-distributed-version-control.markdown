Titus Brown, in a talk he gave at Science 2.0 at MaRS in Toronto last week, talked a lot about distributed version control.  I found this talk inspiring because I had come to much the same conclusion that he did about distributed version control: that it changes one's life.  We currently use CVS for our version control system for Knowledge Forum development.  I had investigated both git and mercurial some time ago but in the end decided that they were "too out there" for use by the sorts of people with whom I tend to work on development issues.  Titus's talk has given me reason to reconsider my rejection of distributed version control, to the point where I am now about to do some more research to help figure out whether mercurial or git is the better choice for my projects.
