A couple of weeks ago I decided that I want to run an experiment.  Rather than doing everything "in the open", I wondered what would happen if we gave people the ability to create a private "research notebook" that they could fiddle about in and then, when and if they want to, be able to push bits out of the private notebook into a more public forum.  I dubbed the system "iKnow/weKnow" (this is in part due to the corporate memory problem that we're grappling with).  I am in the process of doing this with Knowledge Forum.  Basically we'll hand out client-server pairs to every person and everyone will have their own server.  Then, with a slightly modified client, users will be able to push any view in their private database into a community database.  This is similar in some ways to the Replicator that I developed many, many years ago.
