<blockquote>From that perspective, I’m wondering what will and won’t turn out be good enough for the polymathematicians. The current setup is admittedly imperfect, and they’re now begining to explore WordPress plugins that enable, for example, more powerful ways to organize, reply to, and refer to one anothers’ comments.</blockquote>


Those of us who have been using Knowledge Forum know that the sorts of organization, re-organization, building on (rather than replying to) and references that Knowledge Forum supports would be fantastic for supporting the sort of polymath discourse that Jon refers to.  The question that I am mulling over is how to apply Knowledge Forum's power to things like blog postings.  I keep thinking that the right way to do this is to allow any object with a URI to be "wrapped" as a Knowledge Forum note.  I don't think this would be particularly difficult to do.
