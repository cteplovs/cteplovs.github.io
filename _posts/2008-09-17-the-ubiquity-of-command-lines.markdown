As many of my colleagues know I'm a big fan of the command line.  I find it somewhat ironic that I work with information visualizations, and yet I have a penchant for just getting in there with plain old text commands to actually accomplish things.  I even prefer command-line statistical analysis packages (or, perhaps more accurately, the command-line interface to statistical packages).  It probably comes as little surprise that I really like the new [Ubiquity](http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/) plugin for Firefox.  I suspect [Quicksilver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_%28software%29) users will love this.  I know I do.
