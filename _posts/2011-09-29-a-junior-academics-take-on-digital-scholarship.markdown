I’d like to offer my perspective as a junior academic, who is in the process of applying for early career positions, on Martin Weller’s recent and excellent [talk on Digital Scholarship](https://www.fuzemeeting.com/replay_meeting/3d7b3430/2127761). (The talk starts about 20 minutes into the recording.) Deep down I believe in the open, networked, digital scholarship that Martin describes.  The question that I am struggling with is “am I willing to put my life on the line for this belief”.  As Martin points out, tenure and promotion is based on teaching, research, and service.   Peer-reviewed journal publication, as a proxy for research merit assessment, is likely what my hiring and promotion will be based on.  For that reason, I need to start loading the publication pipeline.  Publications don’t happen overnight, and so it’s important for me to focus on this even in the absence of a firm job offer.  At this point in time I’m not willing to jeopardize my family’s well-being to change the system.  Maybe I will be lucky beyond my wildest dreams and wind up at an institution that values open, digital, and networked scholarship, in which case I will be far less concerned about maximizing my peer-reviewed journal publications.  But until that happens the risks associated with committing substantial effort to open scholarship outweigh the benefits.

That doesn’t mean that I won’t blog or participate in learning networks.  It just means that I will adopt a balanced, pragmatic approach that should maximize my chances of success in these exciting times of changing scholarship.
