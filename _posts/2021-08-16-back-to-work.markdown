Today is the first day that I'm officially back and working on the upcoming school year.  
I've tried to take some time off this summer and I'm feeling pretty good, although it's 
amazing how many things have changed (or that I forgot how they worked).  Here's what I
worked on today:

1. Cleaning up my todo lists in OmniFocus

1. Catching up on email
 - I only focused on urgent and recent items, processing approximately 100 emails. I hope to keep up that pace for a while.

2. Copying last year's Canvas course shell to this year's course shell for SI 370.
