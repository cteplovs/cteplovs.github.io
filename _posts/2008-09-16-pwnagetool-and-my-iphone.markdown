This morning, in a wild attempt to actually complete something, I decided to upgrade my 1st-generation iPhone to a more up-to-date version of the firmware.  I grabbed the [PwnageTool](http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/49988701/pwnagetool-and-quickpwn-for-2-1-firmware).  All went well, thanks to the various instructions available around the web.  My only regret: deciding at the final step to "set up phone as new" rather than "restore from backup".  I was concerned about having problems with Mail, per some of the reports, but didn't clue in that I would lose the photos on the iPhone as a result.  There was only one photo that I really regretted losing: a quirky sign on the doors of the library at work warning users about "unstable computers".  Oh well.
