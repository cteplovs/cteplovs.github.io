I've been mulling over a lot of ideas over the past two years about building some software to support advanced knowledge construction.  Ruminating, some would say. This week's glut of hardware acquisitions has reified many of these ideas.  In the end, I'm left with one blazing thought:


_This might not work._


Thanks, [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2013/01/out-on-a-limb.html), for that meme. Understanding that there is a lot of risk involved in what I'm planning, there's no alternative but to move forward at full speed on this.  I'm going to see how far I can move this over the next 12 weeks.  The objective is to move from a mockup to a prototype.  The challenge, as always, is balancing consultancy hours with technology and business development.  The consultancy hours pay for the other stuff, so they can't be ignored.  Whereas I'm feeling pretty good about the technical side of things, the business case is a bit trickier for me.  Recent media reports, however, suggest this is an ideal time for releasing an "innovation support system".  So the time is right for pushing forward on this endeavour.  Next steps: consult some of my mentors about spinning up another startup, get the market research done, and attract some local talent.  I'm setting December 14th as a deadline, and I'll set up milestones for October 11th, November 2nd, and November 23rd.  With luck and perseverance, something good will come of this.  As always, "life" might get in the way.  That's what often happens when one makes plans.  But one can always dream!

Oh, and to remind myself to keep on track, I've set [Philippe de Champaigne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_de_Champaigne)'s _[Vanitas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanitas)_ as my desktop image:
